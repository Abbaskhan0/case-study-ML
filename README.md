## Important Notes
- All Networks are implemented from stratch with minimal use of high level abstraction
- The models were designed to be relatively simple to fit within limited computational resources available during the development timeline. The focus was on building functional pipelines rather than achieving state-of-the-art performance.
- Open source dataset are used , I choose the clean and simple data for demonstration purposed Like (MNIST , IMDB , AMRvoice)
- Inferencing pipilines are created at the end of training notebooks
- All the code is orchestrated & build by myself without using of AI tools or any external help , However in some cases of code debugging , errors handling , utils functions development **AI tools** (google gemini flash 2.0) and refrence from external source like Stack overflow ,Google is being used to met the sucess criteria in tight deadline of 48 hours.
